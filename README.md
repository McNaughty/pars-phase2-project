# P.A.R.S
P.A.R.S is a web application that is meant for scheduling events and also allowing space for participants to register for the events.

Organizers can have their events listed on the calendar that will be accessible to the public who will then have an option to apply and attend or even deregister from the event.

Below is the structure of the application:

1. Landing Page
   This is the first page that every site visitor will see. They will then have the option to register an event or view the calendar for scheduled events.

</p>

2. Event Registration
   This is the module that organizers will use to schedule their events. Data captured is such as event location, event title, organizer, facilitator and the start and end dates.

3. Event Dashboard
   The event dashboard is calendar based whereby users can navigate the different dates to see which events are scheduled. They can then be able to click on an event and see more details about it.
